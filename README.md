Syntax highlighting for JSON5 in Vim
====================================

For [json5](https://github.com/aseemk/json5).

Install
-------

As of vim commit 5a33ce2 (v9.0.2041) and neovim commit eadedfd (v0.9.5), there is no need to manually install this plugin, as the syntax files were merged upstream.

If you're on an older version, you could use your favourite package manager to add `GutenYe/json5.vim`.

Alternatively, manually copy all of the files into your `~/.vim` directory.
